Lecture 1:

Parts of AI Agents:
1. LLM: The reasoning behind our AI agent 
2. Memory: It can be long term or short term 
3. Tools: Different services accessed by different APIs


Lecture 2:

Agentic Frameworks
1. Azure AI agent service: currently designed to be used for single agent both through code and UI 
2. Semantic kernel: Enterprise focused framework 
3. AutoGen: Strong focus on taking the altest agentic research and enabling other researchers and developers to test and experiment with those ideas in code. 

Lecture 3:
What makes a good AI agent?
1. Space: The environment the agent is working in , should focus on connecting events, people and knowledge. An agent should be easily discoverable while being able to 
transition from being in the foreground and background based on the user's needs. 

2. Time: How agent operates over time with user. This is imp because agents can improve over time if we design them well enough

3. Core: This principle is abot embracing uncertainity. Since we are allowing LLMs to create plans and actions on those plans, unceratininty is a key part of agentic design 


Lecture 4:
Use of Tool:
Tasks requested by users sometimes needs external tool sto complete. And the tool design pattern allow LLMs to interact with tools like calculator, FLight API, Function

Lecture 5:
Agentic RAG:
RAG enables LLMs to take a query made from a user and retrieve relevant infromation from the database. That info is then added to the context given to the LLM to provide more relevant responses, 

1. To start on the QUERY side the agent performs an analysis of the query to create a plan of smaller tasks to use the data sources and tools it'll need to answer that query.
